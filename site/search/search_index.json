These are not packaged with PyLag by default in order to keep the base installation slim and easier to manage. If you would like to build the documentation, the extra dependencies can be installed using conda or pip.

Great Lakes coastal wetlands are an important and unique place/location to study coastal wetlands. One of the major stressor is nutrient runoff to coastal wetlands. Coastal wetlands receive nutrients either directly from land or indirectly from lake currents. Great Lake Huron has the longest shoreline among all Great lakes which provide a unique location to study Nutrient flux to coastal wetlands.and fill out this gap to know how much nutrients from lakes are returning to coastal areas. In this study we estimate Nutrient run off from land to coastal wetlands of Lake Huron using Senseflux.
